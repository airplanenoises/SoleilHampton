  ✦ Custom PySide6 UI for intuitive, one-click batch export — minimizing artist error and improving iteration speed

  ✦ Toggleable options for texture export, UV generation, pivot adjustment, and bounding box creation
  
  ✦ Automatic texture collection and conversion (PNG/TGA/JPG/TIFF) using Pillow — ensures consistent format across assets

  ✦ Progress bar and success indicator give real-time feedback during export
  
  ✦ Comprehensive logging (with timestamps and error handling) for easy debugging and batch-process verification

  ✦ “Export Selected” and “Export All” modes provide flexibility for asset-specific or full-scene exports
  
  ✦ Clean code structure separates UI from core logic for maintainability and scalability

  ✦ Robust error handling prevents crashes from missing materials, unassigned shaders, or bad file paths

  ✦ Configurable export settings stored per session for faster repeat exports

  ✦ Organized output folder structure automatically creates “FBX” and “Textures” directories in project workspace
